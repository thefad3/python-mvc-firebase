### Welcome to the python-mvc-firebase wiki!

Check out the live version! [Check out the live working version! ](http://python-mvc-firebase-thefad3.c9.io/)

**This MVC is using Python 2.7 with Flask using Firebase!**

Its a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) application. You must have Flask Installed! 

[Dont know what Flask is? Check them out here!](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

**Also used in the application is Pythons-Firebase REST API Plugin**

Check them out on Github! [https://github.com/ozgur/python-firebase](https://github.com/ozgur/python-firebase)

You can also find a ton of documentation on Firebase's website [here](https://www.firebase.com/docs/)

Passwords are hashed with RSA-SHA1 and no down conversion for security. Flask uses templates as its routes which makes for easy development. 

Security improvements will be coming within the next few weeks as well as full error features. The basics of the application are up and running! More documentation to follow! 

I believe this is the first application based on Python Flask with Firebase that allows for login with session storage.  (As far as I can find)
